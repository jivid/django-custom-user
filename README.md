django-custom-user
==================

A custom user model integrated with the default Django authentication backend. This is based on the feature added in Django 1.5, which allows you to create a custom user model to replace contrib.auth.models.User. The only pre-requisite for this is Django 1.5; if you have an older version and want to upgrade, look <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/install/">here</a>.

See the Django <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/auth/customizing/">docs</a> for more info on customization.
